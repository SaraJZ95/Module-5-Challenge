Analysis

This project saw the analysis of test results involving 249 mice divided in 10 drug treatments, including a placebo/control test regimen based on specific parameters help determine trends, and patterns as well as to draw conclusions that can be used to make informed decisons about anti-cancer medications.

Conclusions drawn from the thorough analyses applied to the complete data from Pymaceuticals' most recent animal study suggests:

There is a postitive correlation between the weight of the mice and the tumor size with a correlation value of 0.84.
Of the 4 drug regimens analyized, Capomulin and Ramicane came up top as the most effective at reducing tumor sizes.
Of the 4 drug regimens analyized, the least effective were the bottom two drugs Infubinol and Ceftamin.
